{"name":"Queuey","tagline":"Extend Activator by rPetrich with action queues, timers, conditionals, and more!","body":"### Welcome to Queuey.\r\nQueuey is an application for jailbroken iOS devices that makes your life awesome by extending Ryan Petrich's famous [Activator](https://github.com/rpetrich/libactivator/) tweak.\r\n\r\n### What is Activator?\r\nActivator, as self described, allows centralized gestures and button management for iOS. Since its debut in 2010, it has garnered a massive following from users in the jailbreak community, due to its power and ease of use.  However, Activator does have its limitations, namely: there is only very basic 'multiple actions' support, there are no timers, and conditional statements are but a dream.\r\n\r\n**Or are they?**\r\n\r\n### What is Queuey?\r\nQueuey extends Activator in all three ways above. Using Queuey, one can set up 'queues', or workflows, that utilize Activator's power and extensibility.  Delays can be freely configured and used to great effect.  In addition, conditional statements (if statements) can be created in a fashionable GUI.\r\n\r\n### Queue Ideas\r\nOnce Queuey is installed, the possibilities are endless! Since Queuey can interact with any Activator plugins installed, interesting possibilities open up.\r\n\r\nOne great example of an extension that Queuey can utilize is HueHueHue, by Ethan Gill (@ethansinjin), one of this project's authors. Using HueHueHue, Queuey can toggle the state of Philips Hue lighting systems over local Wi-Fi. This, accompanied by delays and conditionals, can lead to powerful actions. One could tap the home button three times to turn lights off, wait 5 seconds, turn on Airplane Mode, and start playing music!\r\n\r\n### About the Authors\r\nThis project was completed in under 36 hours by:\r\n* Jaden Geller (@JadenGeller)\r\n* Ethan Gill (@ethansinjin)\r\n\r\nJaden Geller is an awesome person. He currently attends Caltech as a freshman, and is 18 years old.  He attended WWDC 2013 on a student scholarship, and has released several App Store applications.
